<h1 class="body-programming-experience"> My programming experience.</h1>
<p class="paragraph-programming-experience">To be honest I have no experience in coding. <em>HOWEVER</em> I do have knowledge in a two programming languages JAVASCRIPT and PYTHON though the knowledge I have is what one can call beginners level knowledge (the extreme basics).<br>
    I learnt those languages specifically becuase I belived those were the languages I would be taught while at university and I wanted to have some experience before my lectures(also becuause my brothers recommended I learn those languages especailly Python)<br>
    on that note I do wish I am able to learn even more languages while at Hz which would enable me pursue my dreams and ambitions for my future.</p>
