<h2 class="study">Why I choose ICT</h2>
<p class="study-choice"> Well i choose to study ICT as i have noted in my home page due to my interest in Video game development and software design.<br> I have always loved playing video games as a child and when i got older that enjoyment became facination for how the games I play were made.<br> This drove my ambition to excell in IT and computer studies in my secondary school and in WAEC.</p>
<p class="study-choice">Another reason why I chose ICT was simply becuause I understood the importance of ICT in the day to day lives of humans.<br> and due to that the high demand for professionals who have experience in that field of study.<br> Basically the financial gain for ICT professionals.</p>
